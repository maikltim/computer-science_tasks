; Exercise 1.7
; For very small numbers, the approximation may end too early
; due to the comparatively large tolerance, thereby leading
; to a significantly inaccurate result. While for very large
; numbers, the given tolerance may take unbearable time or 
; even impossible to reach since the approximation is too slow
; or the value has gone beyond the machine's floating
; point precision.
